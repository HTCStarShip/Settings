Kindly note that these policies only apply to information collected and stored by HTC Corporation (“HTC”). Each communication must be sent via your wireless operator’s network and your operator may have access to those communications. For information regarding your wireless operator’s treatment of your data, please consult the operator’s privacy policies.
In the event you decide to use third-party applications on your HTC Android Device, any information those applications collect may be sent to third parties and HTC privacy policies shall not apply to those situations. Third-party applications may have their own privacy policies that you should review carefully.
Why HTC collects information
To diagnose problems, continually improve our services and provide a better user experience, we may collect some information and basic usage statistics from your device.
HTC Android Device-related information HTC collects
a) Devices have been allocated one or more unique identification numbers. These identification numbers are associated with your IMEI number, mobile country code, and mobile network code of your device (which is also stored by your wireless operator), and allow your device to sync your email, contacts, and other services.
b) Information such as the hardware model of your device and the version of the Android software you are running may be collected but not stored. In addition, we may collect some information on device-level events such as crashes. Neither of these categories of usage statistics contains application-level information such as the content of emails or phone call records.
Third-party application collected information
a) Some third-party applications will give you the choice of interacting and sharing your information with parties other than HTC. Consider carefully before choosing to share personal information.
b) Some applications or features of your HTC Android Device might cause other information to be sent to HTC but in a manner that cannot be identified with you personally.
c) Your device might send us location information (for example, Cell ID or GPS information).
d) Using some applications or features might send information to Google that is stored with your Google Account if you have signed up for this service. If you use standard Google services on your HTC Android Device, for example by creating new contacts or Calendar events, then this information will be associated with your Google Account and stored consistent with the privacy policies for those services. Likewise, if you use the Android Market, information about your downloads, comments, and ratings will be stored with and accessible through your Google Account. You have the option to disable or not use these features, in which case Google will not receive this data.
e) Some products and services allow you to personalize the content you receive.  For such products and services, the provider may store your preferences and the information you provide for customization.
Third party information sharing & transfer by HTC
a) HTC might share non-personal, aggregated information with selected third parties. However, such information will not identify you personally.
b) HTC might share your information with third parties used to perform functions, such as invoicing and billing related tasks. Such third parties will be required to treat your information in accordance with the applicable HTC confidentiality agreements or privacy policies. HTC might also share your information with your wireless operator in order to perform customer service functions.
Other Uses
a) HTC may use your information to process your requests and deliver services to you, provide customer service functions, and provide you with a better user experience.
b) HTC may also use this information in an aggregated form to develop new features and to improve the overall quality of products and services.
Choice of service
Some of our or third-party products and services allow you to opt-out of certain information gathering and sharing or to opt-out of certain products, services, or features.
Information security
Information received by HTC may be maintained in accordance with the HTC Privacy Statement. The HTC Privacy Statement does not cover third parties' usage of information that you send to them.

3. Privacy Statement

HTC PRIVACY STATEMENT

HTC Corporation ("HTC" or the "Company") owns and operates the HTC IT data network. HTC is committed to protecting the privacy of the HTC IT data network's users and has created this statement to outline the HTC IT data network's information collection practices.
 Anonymous Use
The majority of materials provided under the HTC IT data network are provided for information purposes and you will be able to use the HTC IT data network without informing HTC who you are or providing HTC with any personal data basically. However, HTC might need information about you with respect to your use of the HTC IT data network.
 Information Collection
For the use of HTC Devices, HTC may collect the following information: providing our services to users, including the display of customized content and advertising; auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services; ensuring the technical functioning of our network; and developing new services.
In the event users opt to voluntarily enroll in any membership program on the HTC website, the user consents for HTC to use the personal information provided for specific HTC purposes, including but not limited to, marketing, sales, services, survey, newsletters mailing-list, etc. For instance, by joining the HTC e-Club, users may need to provide HTC with some personal information such as name, mobile phone number, e-mail address, country of origin, and date of birth. In addition, users will be able to choose a password for security as well opt-in for product registration and newsletter subscription all in one convenient step. Please rest assured that HTC takes our user data security seriously, and will implement the proper administrative, technical, and physical measures to safeguard user information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as any unauthorized disclosure, alteration, destruction, or access.
When requesting to be contacted by HTC relevant personnel, users are asked to provide information about themselves and their companies. This information enables HTC relevant personnel to respond promptly and effectively to customer questions and requests. HTC may track the domain names of users and analyze this data. Subject to the provisions of this statement, HTC may use the accumulated data for several purposes, including, but not limited to, marketing analysis, service evaluation, and planning. Through the aforementioned HTC IT data network, HTC may conduct surveys or other studies for marketing and planning purposes. With respect to information collected from such surveys or studies, and in the event that responses are to be publicly disclosed, users will be notified about their participation, and HTC will disclose only aggregate information regarding its users and not personal information identifying any specific individual. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in cases where surveys allow users to submit written comments, and where HTC advises users of the possibility of such disclosure at the time they take the survey, HTC reserves the right to disclose text information provided by any user through such a survey, provided that no personal information identifying that user is disclosed. Participation in such surveys is entirely voluntary. Circumstances under which HTC would publicly disclose such aggregate information include, but are not limited to, sharing survey results with the site population, providing data to the HTC IT data network advertisers on user preferences and/or demographics, and publicizing overall usage data in press communications.
 Opt-in E-mails
Once the user signs up for the HTC e-club, HTC will send an auto-reply confirmation e-mail to the user-directed e-mail account. To make any subsequent newsletter subscription changes such as opt-in or opt-out, the user may go to the "Manage Subscription" page after the user has logged onto the HTC e-Club. Alternatively, the user may click on the provided link in the newsletter e-mail to remove the user from HTC's mailing list. Any request for opt-out requests will take the system at least thirty (30) days to process. In addition, it will take at least ten (10) business days for the server to stop sending e-mail to the given e-mail address.

HTC encourages the HTC IT data network users to be aware when they leave the HTC IT data network and to read the privacy statements of every company site and network they visit.
 Minor's Privacy

HTC does not target, and is not intended for minors. HTC will not knowingly collect data from minors. If HTC discovers personal data from a minor, HTC will eliminate that data.
 Security

Internal access to users' private and non-public personal information is restricted to the network administrators and individuals on a need-to-know basis.
 Enforcement
In the event that HTC becomes aware that the HTC IT data network security has been compromised or user non-public information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including but not limited to external security attacks, HTC shall take reasonable measures that it deems appropriate, including but not limited to internal investigation and reporting and notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities, notwithstanding other provisions of this Statement. If HTC becomes aware that a user's personal information provided to the HTC IT data network has been disclosed in a manner not permitted by this Privacy Statement, HTC shall make reasonable efforts to notify the affected user, as soon as reasonably possible and as permitted by law, of what information has been disclosed, to the extent that the HTC IT data network knows this information. HTC reserves the right to disclose information contained in our access logs concerning any user, as we reasonably feel is necessary to protect our systems or business. In particular, HTC reserves the right to disclose such when a user is in violation of our current or later Terms of Use or other published guidelines, or initiates or participates (or is reasonably believed to do so) in any illegal activity, even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order, and to disclose such information in response to court and governmental orders, civil subpoenas, discovery requests, and as otherwise required by law.
 Data integrity
HTC processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.
 Updates to the Privacy Statement
To update the Privacy Statement, HTC will post both the changed version and its effective date on this page.
 No Guarantees
While this Privacy Statement expresses HTC's standards for maintenance of private data, HTC is not in a position to guarantee that the standards will always be met. Some factors beyond our control may result in disclosure of data. As a consequence, HTC disclaims any warranties or representations relating to maintenance or nondisclosure of private information.
